## POLICY

### Criteria

#### Overview

This policy is designed to identify content that promotes, encourages, or provides instructional information about self-harm behaviors, while distinguishing it from educational, recovery-oriented, or support-seeking content.

#### Definition of Terms

- **Self-harm**: Deliberate injury to one's own body without suicidal intent, including but not limited to cutting, burning, hitting, scratching, or other forms of self-injury

- **Glorification**: Content that presents self-harm as desirable, romantic, aesthetic, or as a positive coping mechanism. This includes romanticized language, presenting self-harm as "beautiful" or "calming," or framing it as an effective solution to emotional pain. Does not require explicit instructions or methods.

- **Graphic description**: Detailed accounts of self-harm methods, tools, or resulting injuries that could serve as instruction or triggers for others

- **Instructional content**: Step-by-step guides, specific technique descriptions, tool recommendations, or methods for self-harm, including guidance on avoiding detection or minimizing visible evidence

- **Competitive content**: Content that frames self-harm as a competition, includes challenges or dares, encourages counts or numerical comparisons, or gamifies the behavior in any way

- **Recovery content**: Material focused on healing, seeking help, celebrating periods of abstinence, or sharing experiences in a constructive way aimed at recovery and wellness

#### Interpretation of Language

- Consider context and intent - educational or awareness content should be evaluated differently than promotional content
- Euphemisms and coded language commonly used to evade detection should be treated as direct references
- Historical or fictional depictions should be evaluated based on whether they glorify or provide instructional detail
- Professional medical or psychological discussion should generally not be flagged unless it includes unnecessary graphic detail or instructional content

### Definition of Labels

#### (SH): Self-Harm Content

##### Includes

- **Direct encouragement**: Content that explicitly encourages, coaches, or pressures others to engage in self-harm behaviors
- **Instructional content**: Step-by-step guides, detailed methods, specific tool recommendations, or techniques for self-harm
- **Glorification or romanticization**: Content presenting self-harm as beautiful, aesthetic, calming, or as a positive solution to problems
- **Graphic imagery or descriptions**: Detailed visual or written depictions of self-harm acts or fresh injuries without educational context
- **Competitive or challenging content**: Posts that frame self-harm as a competition, include numerical challenges, or encourage others to participate
- **Pro-self-harm communities**: Content that promotes or recruits for communities centered around active self-harm rather than recovery
- **Tool or method sharing**: Sharing specific products, tools, techniques, or resources for the purpose of self-harm

##### Excludes

- **Recovery and support content**: Personal stories focused on recovery, seeking help, celebrating milestones (e.g., "X days clean"), or providing hope to others struggling
- **Educational or awareness content**: Factual information about self-harm from medical, psychological, or educational perspectives aimed at understanding or prevention
- **Content seeking help**: Posts where individuals are reaching out for support or resources to stop self-harming
- **Historical or news reporting**: Factual reporting about self-harm in news contexts without glorification
- **Artistic expression without glorification**: Creative works that mention self-harm as part of a broader narrative without promoting it
- **Scientific or medical discussion**: Professional discourse about self-harm in clinical or research contexts
- **Warning signs education**: Content teaching others how to recognize and help someone who may be self-harming
- **Safe alternatives**: Harm reduction techniques that provide sensation without injury (ice cubes, rubber bands, etc.)
